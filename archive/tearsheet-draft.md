# Takuma Bespoke

## Your intuition, delivered at scale.

### What makes us different?
We build systems that amplify your judgment, not automate it away. While everyone else builds AI that thinks for you, we build AI that thinks like you. Your pipe dreams - the ten products you'd build if you had the bandwidth - they're buildable now. Without hiring. Without fundraising. Without compromising what makes your work yours.

### What we actually do
We encode your intuition into intelligent systems. Through intensive workshops where you drive and we navigate, we build products that work the way you work. Not generic tools. Not automated workflows. Systems that apply your specific judgment at scale.

### Who we work with
Founders who understand AI is about amplification, not automation. If you're looking to outsource your thinking, we're not for you. If you want to expand what you're capable of while staying in the driver's seat - let's talk.

### How we work
**Two-week intensive: $5,000**
We unpack your methodology, identify the patterns that matter, and build the first working system that embodies your approach. You leave with something that ships, not slides.

**Continued development: Custom**
We evolve the system with you, adding capabilities as your intuition reveals new patterns worth preserving.

### The outcome you can expect
Stop choosing between your best ideas. Build all of them. Your judgment and intuition, amplified to handle the scope you've always envisioned. Not by hiring people to execute your vision, but by encoding your vision into systems that execute.

### Ready to amplify?
**Book a call.** We'll unpack the epicenter of what you want to build and show you exactly how your intuition becomes scalable.
